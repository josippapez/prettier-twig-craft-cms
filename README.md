# prettier-twig-craft-cms

This is an extension to [prettier-plugin-twig-melody](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-twig-melody) which should ultimately cover the Twig tags added by [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add prettier-twig-craft-cms --dev
```

or

```bash
npm install prettier-twig-craft-cms --save-dev
```

## Usage

You have to add this line in your `.prettierrc` (or `prettierrc.json`) file:

```json
"twigMelodyPlugins": ["node_modules/prettier-twig-craft-cms"]
```

This should be it.
